# Self learning Basketball Game

## Basketball Game made with Unity

A simple 2D basketball game where the only challenge for the regular player is to score a point (yes, one point, it's not real basketball). It is pretty challenging, time to bring out your inner Michael Jordan.

## Self learning with a genetic algorithm

If you got tired of being bad at the game, no worries, there is a solution for the computer to play with itself ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). Using a parameterized genetic algorithm by the launch force and direction of the basketball, the algorithm will find the perfect pairing to score a point and to be better than you.
